# ShapeGuessingGame

Created with JavaFX and SceneBuilder. This is a game where the user guesses if the shape is a rectangle or circle, similar to heads or tails. Their guessing records are stored in a SQL database, as well as the correct answer corresponding to each guess. Their total guesses and total correct guesses are also kept track of.

Features:
  Start a new game, clears all previous guessing data
  Display guessing data into a list view
  Animate the shape guessed and show whether or not the using was correct.
  Randomly generate a correct shape each time for the player to guess.
